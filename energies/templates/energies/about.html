    <h2>üìò Our Journey Began with a Dream</h2>
    
    <p>
      Samyati Energies was born out of an inspiring final year project by its founders, <strong>Aditya Acharya & Risav Gartaula</strong>, at 
      <strong>Thapathali Campus, Tribhuvan University</strong>, where they studied Automobile Engineering.
      Driven by curiosity and a passion for innovation, the team set out to build a fully functional 
      <strong>electric bike (EV bike)</strong>‚Äîa bold step toward clean mobility in Nepal. Their successful project 
      marked the beginning of a much larger vision: to accelerate the shift toward eco-friendly 
      transportation across the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What began in a university lab is now a real-world mission‚Äîto deliver advanced lithium-ion battery 
      solutions that empower Nepal‚Äôs electric future.

    <h3>üîß From Petrol to Electric</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to their groundbreaking EV bike project, the founders collaborated with <strong>Itahari Sub-Metropolitan City</strong> 
      to convert two petrol-engine bikes into electric vehicles. These converted bikes showcased impressive performance, achieving 
      an average range of 80 kilometers on a full charge. This milestone further demonstrated their commitment to advancing sustainable transportation solutions across Nepal.
